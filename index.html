            <p class="slide-in">Hi! Iâ€™m Joel, a dedicated tutor with a passion for helping students achieve their academic goals. 
                I have successfully attained 4 A*s at A-level in Maths, Further Maths, Physics, and Chemistry, alongside achieving a Grade 9 in GCSE Maths and a remarkable 9-9 in Combined Science.
                 These accomplishments reflect my deep understanding of these subjects and my commitment to excellence. 
                 Based in Newcastle, I offer both online and in-person tutoring services tailored to meet the unique needs of each student. 
                 My approach is not only about teaching concepts but also about inspiring confidence and fostering a love for learning. 
                 Additionally, I was honored with a prestigious scholarship for my outstanding performance in my first year at Newcastle University, 
                 a recognition that further motivates me to provide the highest quality of education to my students. Together, we can unlock your potential 
                 and pave the way for your academic success.</p>
